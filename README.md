Description:
Part1:
Creates points on a polar field or cartesian plane. There are 3 different implementations of ways to do this, initially we use just PointCP
which stores the values as either Cartesian or Polar, and the other two implementations are storing these values in either Cartesian, or Polar and convert to the other if you need to convert the type. We discovered that storing as Cartesian values and converting to others is faster then storing in polar form. 

Part2:
Analyzes the difference between ArrayList, Vector, and arrays in Java. By testing multiple functions in these, we determined that ArrayList was the fastest option too use for a). For b) however we determined that vectors iteration time to perform all its functions was faster then that of ArrayList and array.
